# aggresiveness-detection

This repository contains some experiments to understand the hate speech detection problem. We'll explore the following papers:

* http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2664/mexa3t_paper9.pdf
* https://aclanthology.org/S19-2007.pdf
* https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8292838

Also, we'll create a twitter scrapper to continue collecting more data.
